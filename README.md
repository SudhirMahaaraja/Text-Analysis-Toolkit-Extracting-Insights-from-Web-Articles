    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-analysis-tool.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-analysis-tool
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Prepare input data:

   - Create an Excel file named `Input.xlsx`.
   - Enter the URLs of the articles you want to analyze in the `URL` column.
   - Optionally, you can include a unique identifier for each URL in the `URL_ID` column.

5. Prepare dictionaries and stop word files:
   - Positive and negative word dictionaries: Ensure you have `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt`.
   - Stop word files: Ensure you have stop word files in the project directory or adjust file paths in the code accordingly.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python text_analysis.py
    ```

2. The tool will extract text from the provided URLs, perform analysis, and save the results to an Excel file named `Output.xlsx`.

## Example

- `Input.xlsx`:

    | URL_ID | URL                                 |
    |--------|-------------------------------------|
    | 1      | https://example.com/article1        |
    | 2      | https://example.com/article2        |
    | ...    | ...                                 |

- `Output.xlsx`:
